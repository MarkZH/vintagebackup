# Other options

## Logging

### `--log`

Specify an alternate location for the log file.
The parameter is a file name.

### `--error-log`

Specify a log file that only receives warnings and errors.
The parameter is a file name.
If a backup or othe process runs without errors, this file will not be created.
If the file in the parameter is placed in a prominent location (like the Desktop), then the full log does not need to be inspected as often--only when the error log appears to indicate something went wrong.
